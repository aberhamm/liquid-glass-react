   * yields the light treatment (`overLight`-equivalent), a dark backdrop the

   *
   * ## Precedence (documented rule)
   *
   * An EXPLICIT {@link overLight} always wins. `adaptiveTint` only drives the

   *
   * ## Graceful degradation
   *
   * When the backdrop cannot be sampled (cross-origin-tainted canvas, no canvas,
   * SSR) the reading is `sampled: false` and auto-tint falls back to

   * ## Accessibility interaction
   *
   * Under `(prefers-contrast: more)` (plan 014) the high-contrast treatment wins:
   * auto-tint never undercuts the increased-contrast surface/legibility treatment.
   *
   * ## Limitation
   *
   * Auto-tint is BEST-EFFORT legibility. Critical text over unknown or
   * cross-origin backdrops (which cannot be sampled) should be verified manually —
   * the auto path silently falls back rather than guessing.

   *
   * ## Interaction rules
   *
   * - **Clear is non-adaptive by definition.** In `'clear'`, {@link adaptiveTint}
   *   is a **no-op** — the glass never samples the backdrop and never flips its
   *   tint/ink. (Use `'regular'` + `adaptiveTint` for the adaptive material.)
   * - **`overLight` still nudges legibility, not adaptivity.** In `'clear'`, an
   *   explicit {@link overLight} may still tune the dimming/legibility treatment,
   *   but it does NOT re-enable the adaptive sampling path.
   * - **Accessibility wins.** Under `(prefers-contrast: more)` (plan 014) the
   *   high-contrast treatment STILL applies in both variants — a11y beats the
   *   Clear aesthetic, so Clear surfaces become legible/high-contrast when the
   *   user asks for it.
   *
